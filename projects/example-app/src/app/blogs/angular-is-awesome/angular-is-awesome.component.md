## Angular is awesome still in 2021

Hello guys, this post is about Angular.

Is it still relevant?

What should we are doing in the future?

<div *ngIf="show">

* *ngFor="let item of items" <div><h3>List Item Titel: {{item}} </h3>`test`</div>
  
</div>

```
function test() {
  console.log('Hello world!");
}
```
